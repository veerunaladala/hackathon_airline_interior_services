The service was bad to non-existent. 2 crew members for a rather large area.
"Service and food were excellent, I've never landed from a long flight feeling full."
Exit row seats offer a great amount of space and are really comfortable.
"IFE system feels a bit old, but it works fine."
NO under seat storage (for a woman with a purse this is exceptionally annoying)
"I'd put 94K in a darker red as it is much worse than 93B: not only do you have the same issues (catering carts, crew passages and proximity to the lavatories), it is also the side of the cabin with the stairs meaning there is also movements from the two decks that will stop your rest."
The premium economy seats are hard: about 6 hrs. into the flight my butt was numb.
"However, the additional cost for premium economy is worth it for the added space, service, and the small, 21-seat cabin section."
"The inflight entertainment (IFE) system in Economy class on this aircraft is quite antiquated and makes for a less-than-satisfying experience. The screen size is VERY small, the systems are VERY old, the touchscreens are functional, but not very responsive."
The main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films. Rubbish. Took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work. The plane looks old and tired. Not a pleasure to travel on this plane.
"The seat on my LHR-HKG was pretty normal. BTW, the English Breakfast was amazing. Also, the English Breakfast has no baked beans which was good because I don't like baked beans. Unfortunately, the first meal wasn't too good."
Avoid this business class seat. Itâ€™s proximity to the galley makes it incredibly noisy & more specifically because the galley on this side of the plane has the fridge & other spaces the crew constantly accesses
"Very comfortable, excellent leg room, good recline"
A great Club World seat with extra overhead storage and slightly more space when the seat is fully reclined.
Restricted legroom due to box under the seat in front.
"very noisy due to the nearby kittchen, no (NO) place to keep goods, very small and uncomfortable business class seats with non-adustable footrest, passengers must step above the footrest. Badest BC experience ever"
"Very disappointing business class. My first thought was ""how old is this plane""? The entertainment equipment is from another era -- slow, small screen and difficult to use. Even the food on this flight was less than Air France standard. Will probably try to avoid Air France in the future which is a shame because it used to be one of my favorite airlines."
"Tiny screens, feels like travelling in the early 2000s. Flight was not full so that made up for the lack of amenities. IF the flight was full it would have been challenging. Crew was polite, so that was a plus."
"Ample legroom between the seat and the bulkhead. Easy to slip out past a sleeping seatmate. Only negative is that the overhead bins are small for this size plane and since you have to put bags up for taxi, takeoff, and landing, it can be tough."
