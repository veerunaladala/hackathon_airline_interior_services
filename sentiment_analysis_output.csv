5,"I'd put 94K in a darker red as it is much worse than 93B: not only do you have the same issues (catering carts, crew passages and proximity to the lavatories), it is also the side of the cabin with the stairs meaning there is also movements from the two decks that will stop your rest.","i'd put 94k in a darker red as it is much worse than 93b: not only do you have the same issues (catering carts, crew passages and proximity to the lavatories), it is also the side of the cabin with the stairs meaning there is also movements from the two decks that will stop your rest.",red bad stop,0

8,"The inflight entertainment (IFE) system in Economy class on this aircraft is quite antiquated and makes for a less-than-satisfying experience.

9,The main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films. Rubbish. Took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work. The plane looks old and tired.

11,Avoid this business class seat. It’s proximity to the galley makes it incredibly noisy & more specifically because the galley on this side of the plane has the fridge & other spaces the crew constantly accesses,avoid this business class seat. it’s proximity to the galley makes it incredibly noisy & more specifically because the galley on this side of the plane has the fridge & other spaces the crew constantly accesses,avoid make noisy access,0

16,"Very disappointing business class. My first thought was ""how old is this plane""? The entertainment equipment is from another era -- slow, small screen and difficult to use. Even the food on this flight was less than Air France standard. Will probably try to avoid Air France in the future which is a shame because it used to be one of my favorite airlines.","very disappointing business class. my first thought was ""how old is this plane""? the entertainment equipment is from another era -- slow, small screen and difficult to use. even the food on this flight was less than air france standard. will probably try to avoid air france in the future which is a shame because it used to be one of my favorite airlines.",disappointing old slow small difficult use try avoid favorite,0
17,"Tiny screens, feels like travelling in the early 2000s. Flight was not full so that made up for the lack of amenities. IF the flight was full it would have been challenging. Crew was polite, so that was a plus.","tiny screens, feels like travelling in the early 2000s. flight was not full so that made up for the lack of amenities. if the flight was full it would have been challenging. crew was polite, so that was a plus.",tiny feel travel early challenge polite,1
18,"Ample legroom between the seat and the bulkhead. Easy to slip out past a sleeping seatmate. Only negative is that the overhead bins are small for this size plane and since you have to put bags up for taxi, takeoff, and landing, it can be tough.","ample legroom between the seat and the bulkhead. easy to slip out past a sleeping seatmate. only negative is that the overhead bins are small for this size plane and since you have to put bags up for taxi, takeoff, and landing, it can be tough.",ample easy slip sleep negative overhead small tough,1
